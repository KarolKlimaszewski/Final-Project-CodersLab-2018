# React Finance App

Simple Personal Finance Manager app built with React for final project after completing the Front End course "JavaScript developer: React".

This is React app to manage expenses and incomes. In app, you can add items (expenses or incomes),
filter items by date, amount or comment. You can also delete
each operation from history. Database is handled with Firebase.

In the future, i want to add some additional filters, sorting and login for users, to let each user have own history of operations.
I want also to learn Redux and add it to this app.
